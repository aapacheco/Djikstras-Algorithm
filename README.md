# Djikstras Algorithm
This small Java program demonstrates the usage of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two airports in a network of interconnected airports. The program uses a weighted graph to represent the connections between airports, with the weights representing the distances between them.

## Installation

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

1. The program reads in a provided file that represents the connections between airports.
2. After reading in the CSV file, the program prompts the user to enter the origin and destination airport codes.
3. The program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the two airports and outputs the result.

## Technologies Used
